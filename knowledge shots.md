### Brief Overview:  

(1). _COMPUTER VISION_  
Using a combination of cameras and software to find lane lines on difficult roads and to track vehicles.  

Project 1: **Finding Lane Lines on the Road**  
In this project, I wrote code to identify lane lines on the road, first in an image, and later in a video stream. To complete this project I used Python, OpenCV and other tools I learned about in the Computer Vision course lessons and built upon them.  

Project 2: **Advanced Lane Finding**  
Building on the previous project, I accomplished my goal of writing a software pipeline to identify the lane boundaries in a video from a front-facing camera on a car. The output annotated video identifies: the positions of the lane lines, the location of the vehicle relative to the center of the lane, the radius of curvature of the road.  


(2). DEEP LEARNING  
Deep learning is the most important frontier in both machine learning and autonomous vehicle development. I learned from Experts from NVIDIA to build deep neural networks and train them with data from the real world and from the Udacity simulator. Later, I trained convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs, and then trained a neural network to drive a vehicle in the simulator!  

Project 3: **Traffic Sign Classifier**  
In this project, you will use what you've learned about deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs.  

Project 4: **Behavioral Cloning**  
Using the deep learning skills I gained from the course modules and coding-quizzes, I trained a deep neural network to drive a car like a human does!  

(3). SENSOR FUSION  
Tracking objects over time is a major challenge for understanding the environment surrounding a vehicle. It was a pleasure learning from Sensor fusion engineers from Mercedes-Benz to program fundamental mathematical tools called Kalman filters. I used these filters to predict and determine with certainty the location of other vehicles on the road. Also, I used an advanced technique called Extended Klaman Filter to do the same with difficult-to-follow objects.  

Project 5: **Extended Kalman Filter**  
I implemented an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) using the Constant Velocity (CV) model in C++ to fuse together data from RADAR and LIDAR. I tracked a bicycle's (that travels around the car) position & velocity using noisy LIDAR and RADAR measurements.
