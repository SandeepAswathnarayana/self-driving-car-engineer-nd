Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree, Udacity  


**A Note To Readers**:  
- Please find the **'System Integration and Programming a Real Self-Driving Car'** Final Capstone on [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/SandeepAswathnarayana/Udacity-SDCND-Programming-a-Real-Self-Driving-Car).  
- Given the time constraints and concrete schedule, I have given my best to learn, build the modules in implenting a working prototype and/or model. After having completed the SDC Nanodegree, I have kept myself occupied learning innovative approaches from the smartest minds in the field. And, I have only been altering my intuition for the better ever since.  
- Should you have any inputs that you want to share with me (or) provide me with any relevant feedback on my projects or approach, Iâ€™d be glad to hear from you. Please feel free to connect with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ThisIsSandeepA), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandeep-a/), or follow me on [GitHub](https://github.com/SandeepAswathnarayana).
