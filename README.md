Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree, Udacity  


**Note To Readers**:  
- Please find the **'System Integration and Programming a Real Self-Driving Car'** Final Capstone on my **[GitHub repository](https://github.com/SandeepAswathnarayana/Udacity-SDCND-Programming-a-Real-Self-Driving-Car)**.  
- A comprehensive explanation and instructions on how to modify the code to build and deploy your own custom object detection model is available on my **[Medium article](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-build-a-custom-object-detector-classifier-using-tensorflow-object-detection-api-811b7bcd31c4)**.  
- Given the time constraint and my concrete schedule, I have given my best to learn and build the modules in an attempt to implent working prototypes and models. After having completed the SDC Nanodegree, I have kept my learning appetite active by: (a) working towards applying the state-of-the-art models and (b) following the works of some of the smartest minds in the field. I have only been strengthening my intuition based on Innovation ever since.  
- Should you have any inputs that you want to share with me (or) provide me with any relevant feedback on my projects or approach, Iâ€™d be glad to hear from you. Please feel free to connect with me on **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/ThisIsSandeepA)**, **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandeep-a/)**, or follow me on **[GitHub](https://github.com/SandeepAswathnarayana)**.  


Also, this repository is still under development. Any potential improvements or iterations would be added in the future.
